# Raft

My own take on an interpreted programming language, inspired by Alexey Kutepov (Tsoding)'s [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

## Compiling the Interpreter

To compile, you should only need to run the build script. At this time, I have only included a Windows script, 
but once the project is further into development a *nix version will be added.

## Project Milestones

Coming soon

## Commands & Operations

Check out doc/reference.txt for list of implemented operations.
