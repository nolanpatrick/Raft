# North

My own take on a custom, stack-based interpreted programming language. Syntactically inspired by Forth.
Project idea shamelessly stolen from Alexey Kutepov (Tsoding)'s [Porth](https://gitlab.com/tsoding/porth).

## Compiling

To compile, you should only need to run the build script. At this time, I have only included a Windows script, 
but once the project is further into development a *nix version will be added.

## Project Milestones
Coming soon
